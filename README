A collection of snippets for Sublime Text 2.

Snippets are a content insertion feature of text editors such as Sublime Text 2 or TextMate. A Snippet allows you to create libraries and templates of commonly used code or other character-based to insert into your project with a trigger word or alias. 

Sublime Text 2 allows you to trigger an alias with the tab key. The following example shows the "hello" alias used to insert a string of text. 

<snippet>
	<content>
	HelloWorld! I am a snippet!
	</content>
	<tabTrigger>hello</tabTrigger>
	<scope>text.xml</scope>
</snippet>

This snippet file is saved in the Packages folder in your system Library. The Packages contain subdirectories for each code type, allowing you to create snippets specific to XML, C# or other projects. 

/Users/davedri/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/XML

The above example uses the <scope> element to define that that trigger will only work on a file saved with the XML file suffix. This allows you to customise your libraries by language or even project, where a dummy file suffix for a text file might correspond to a scope definition to limit replacement triggers to that project alone.


Known Issue:

OS X hides the User level Library. You can show all hidden files by running the following string in a Terminal session.

1. Launch Terminal.
2. Type in the following command.
defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles true
3. Relaunch Finder in either the Terminal or via the GUI.
	3a: Terminal method - type the following:
	killall Finder
	3b: GUI method - Hold down the Control and Option keys and click on the Finder icon in the Dock. Select Relaunch.

To reverse the process
defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles false
